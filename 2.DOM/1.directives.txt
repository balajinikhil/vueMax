Directives are set of instructions we place in code

1. v-bind:attribute = 'data.property'
    ex- v-bing:href='link'  where link is defined in the data of vue instance
This binds the dataproperty to the attribute


2. v-on:event = 'methods'
    ex- v-on:click='updateCount'
    updateCount is defined in the methods of vue instance and is executed on each click event 
This binds the methods to the event

3. v-once 
    It renders the data only once (first time)
    If value changes after the rendering it dosen't update as it binds only once

4.v-html="dataPropertyName"
    dataPropertyName - holds the html elment which has to be rendered
    To include html element which is present in the data object of vue instance, if this is not included then the html element is render as a string

    @event === v-on:event
    :attribute === v-bind

5. v-model='property'
    ex- <input  v-model='property'>
        <p>{{property}}
        displays the property in the input field and updates the property as input changes
