v-for='el in array'> {{el}}
    works like for loop of js 
    has acess to (el,i) renders the item as many times as the element exist

    (el,i)

v-for for objects we have acess to (value, key, index)

v-for='n in 10' if we enter number it will loop through induvidual value till we get to that number
