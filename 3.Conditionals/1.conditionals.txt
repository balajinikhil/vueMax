v-if='property'
    works like an if statement if the property is true the element gets rendered if else it os removed from the DOM rendering

v-else
    works like js else statement binding to the latest v-if above

There is no else if we will have to use multiple v-if statements

v-show='property'
    Unlike v-if , v-show renders the property but sets the display as none


If you don't want to wrap the element inside a div and condition it we can wrap inside template tag which wraps the element but dosen't get rendered in the DOM
